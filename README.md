# Soundscape
This soundscape was an improv idea after many technical errors. I was with professor Flynn working through the technical issues when we decided to do a spontaneous interview with the background noise of some chattering Hillman students for my soundscape.

One of my imported tracks was too big to import here, it was the opening sound. But, it was public domain and ill paste it here https://freesound.org/people/eliasyian/sounds/140481/
