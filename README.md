# Soundscape
This soundscape was an impromtu idea after many technical errors. I was with professor Flynn working through the technical issues when we decided to do a spontaneous interview with the background noise of some chattering Hillman students for my soundscape. I remember professor Flynn at one point had said that the abundant problems I ran into for this project would one day be a great thing to bring up in an interview when asked about trials and tribulations with technology. Once we had worked through the problems and celebrated our successes I began to acknowledge just how true that statement was. Though frustrating, this project will go down in history as what I bring up in interviews.
